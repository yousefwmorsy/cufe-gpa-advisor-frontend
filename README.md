# Advanced GPA Advisor Frontend (Angular)

This folder contains the Angular frontend for the Advanced GPA Advisor web app.

## Features
- Local-first GPA management, transcript upload, dashboards, simulation, and AI advisor chat.
- Modern dark theme using TailwindCSS.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start the development server with `ng serve`.

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
